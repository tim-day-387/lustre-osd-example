Learnings (Update OSD docs)
- Be careful about saying what exists
  and what doesn't (LOHA_EXISTS)
- osd_object are primarily created for
  accounting purposes (both for caching and
  within the context of transactions)
- osd_oi handles translating FIDs into handles
  to objects that actually contain data (that
  may be an inode or a ref to some osd_data
  object)
- lu_object_find_at() seems to handle finding
  pre-existing objects associated with a FID;
  hence, we shouldn't have to worry about two
  osd_object conflicting (i.e. having the same
  FID)
- There are multiple dt_index_operations defined
  because they represent three different indices
  with unique data
- osd_index_try() is passed all of the information
  needed to define an index via the features
  parameter
- We need to be able to create arbitrary indices,
  that could use unique (key, value) pairs; this
  could be lbufs in a linked list; the directory
  provides all of the information we need to
  implement this functionality

TODO (Debugging)
- Need to map FIDs to something more
  meaningful!
- Clean up logging and debugging (levels,
  transactions, better state logs)
- Add better object lifecycle logging
- Add invariant checks alongside tracing

TOOD (Bugs)
- osd_statfs() sets up a bunch of state
  about the OSD so Lustre can use it; we
  should attempt to return correct info
- Index operations need to be filled out
  more (freeing, deleting, and more!)
- Be careful about passing back correct info
  to callers
- Do proper attr management; we should capture
  all data passed about osd_object and push it
  to osd_data
- index and xattr handling have a lot of duplication;
  think of ways to reduce this?
- Check lustre/include/dt_object.h for proper
  return codes on functions?
- The parent/child relationship isn't likely
  being expressed correctly?
- On cleanup, we can crash on osp_sync_thread(), with
  ASSERTION(count < 10)
- Add invariant checking! Our verbose logging to too much
  for real testing!
- Need to run every sanity.sh test one-by-one to see
  which are broken!
- Revisit dir index with a focus on sanity/24v and
  sanity/24A

TODO (QoL)
- Improve stucture naming so we don't copy what all
  of the other OSDs are doing (grep!)
- Think about clarifying file structure
- Remove weird test script nested sanity test stuff
- Fix kernel configure stuff
